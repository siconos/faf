  abstract =	 "{This book concerns the numerical simulation of
                  dynamical systems whose trajectories may be not
                  differentiable. These systems are called nonsmooth
                  dynamical systems, and they represent an important
                  class of systems, firstly because of many
                  applications in which nonsmooth models are useful,
                  secondly because they give rise to new problems in
                  various fields of mathematics and computational
                  mechanics.  The book is divided into three parts.
                  The first part presents the formulation of nonsmooth
                  dynamical systems, with model problems from
                  mechanics, electricity and control, as well as
                  useful material from convex and nonsmooth analysis
                  related to differential inclusions, variational
                  inequalities, and complementarity systems. The model
                  applications are taken from multibody systems with
                  contact, impact and friction, and from electrical
                  circuits with piecewise linear and ideal components.
                  The second part deals with numerical
                  time-integration schemes, which can be divided into
                  event-driven schemes and time-stepping schemes.  The
                  third part is devoted to one-step nonsmooth problem
                  solvers, and includes techniques suitable for the
                  solution of variational inequalities, nonlinear
                  programming problems and complementarity
                  problems. The one-step problems include the
                  nonlinear models known as holonomic models, which
                  have a long tradition in engineering mechanics (cf.
                  unilateral contact for static elastic bodies, the
                  holonomic or Hencky model of plasticity). Nonsmooth
                  modelling in mechanics is based on the seminal works
                  of J. J. Moreau and T. Rockafellar on convex
                  analysis and its usage in contact mechanics and
                  elastoplasticity, as well as on later extensions to
                  nonconvex problems by P. D. Panagiotopoulos. This
                  development has been documented in a number of
                  research monographs like [{\it R. T. Rockafellar},
                  Convex Analysis. Princeton Landmarks in
                  Mathematics. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University
                  Press (1997; Zbl 0932.90001); {\it P. D.
                  Panagiotopoulos}, Inequality problems in mechanics
                  and applications. Convex and nonconvex energy
                  functions. Boston-Basel-Stuttgart: Birkh\"{a}user
                  (1985; Zbl 0579.73014); {\it J. J. Moreau,
                  P. D. Panagiotopoulos}, Nonsmooth mechanics and
                  applications. CISM Courses and Lectures, 302. Wien
                  etc.: Springer-Verlag (1988; Zbl 0652.00016)] and in
                  many others.  Practical applications of nonsmooth
                  mechanics are also presented in research monographs,
                  see e.g. [{\it F. Pfeiffer, C. Glocker}, Multibody
                  dynamics with unilateral contacts. CISM Courses and
                  Lectures. 421. Wien etc.: Springer-Verlag (2000; Zbl
                  0960.00025)].  The present book is a research
                  monograph with numerous information and references
                  to original publications which gives to the book an
                  encyclopaedic nature. The wealth of information and
                  solution methods mentioned in this book certainly
                  shows that the area of nonsmooth mechanics has
                  arrived a level of maturity that allows for serious
                  industrial applications, without loosing its
                  attractiveness for research purposes. The parallel
                  presentation of nonsmooth models in mechanics and
                  electronics indicates that the mentioned effects
                  will also be of interest for people working in
                  mechatronics, microelectromechanics and
                  multiphysics.  The book is intended for graduate
                  students and scientists doing research and
                  development in mechanics and electrical engineering,
                  designers of modern electromechanical devices, as
                  well as to researchers from other scientific
                  communities like applied mathematics, robotics,
                  civil and mechanical engineering, mechatronics,

                  approach is to capture and treat directly the
                  friction model as a parametric quadratic
                  optimization problem with second-order cone
                  constraints coupled with a fixed point
                  equation. This intrinsic formulation allows a simple
                  existence proof under reasonable assumptions, as
                  well as a variety of solution algorithms. We study
                  mechanical interpretations of these assumptions,
                  showing in particular that they are actually
                  necessary and sufficient for a basic example similar
                  to the so-called “paradox of Painlev\'e”. Finally, we
                  present some implementations and experiments to
                  illustrate the practical aspect of our work.},

  abstract =	 "Nowadays, the concept of convex potential of
                  dissipation is a powerful tool customarily used to
                  model the constitutive dissipative
                  laws. Unfortunately, it fails when applied to
                  Coulomb's dry friction contact, which is shown in
                  this paper by checking the cyclic monotony
                  condition. Next, a new approach, the bipotential
                  method, is presented and successfully applied to the
                  contact law. This enables us to write it in a
                  compact form and to uncover an implicit normality
                  rule structure. The advantages of the new approach
                  are numerous, among which is emphasized a pretty
                  extension of the calculus of variation. Two minimum
                  principles of the so-called bifunctional are
                  presented for contact problems. Next, the
                  bipotential method can be qualified as constitutive
                  in the sense that it suggests improved numerical
                  algorithms. In particular, it is proved that the
                  complete contact law can be rewritten as a
                  projection equation onto Coulomb's cone. Numerical
                  examples show the feasibility of the algorithm and
                  the computer time reduction with respect to other
                  previous numerical approaches. "

                  deforming with an arbitrary static loading

                  virtual work are used to formulate the interface
                  element for a finite element solution

                  include; easy implementation intostandard finite
                  element programs, direct determination of interface
                  forces without round-off problems, and the

                  an idealized buried culvert problem illustrates that

                  for a long-span culvert installation with
                  incremental soil loading, demonstrates the
                  importance of modelling slippage at the culvert–soil

abstract = "Abstract Non-smooth contact dynamics provides an increasingly popular simulation framework for granular material. In contrast to classical discrete element methods, this approach is stable for arbitrary time steps and produces visually acceptable results in very short computing time. Yet when it comes to the prediction of draft forces, non-smooth contact dynamics is typically not accurate enough. We therefore propose to combine the method class with an interior point algorithm for higher accuracy. Our specific algorithm is based on the so-called Jordan algebras and exploits the relation to symmetric cones in order to tackle the conical constraints that are intrinsic to frictional contact problems. In every interior point iteration a linear system has to be solved. We analyze how the interior point method behaves when it is combined with Krylov subspace solvers and incomplete factorizations. We show that efficient preconditioners and efficient linear solvers are essential for the method to be applicable to large-scale problems. Using \{CG\} as a linear solver and incomplete \{LU\} factorizations, we substantially improve the accuracy in comparison to the projected Gauß–Jacobi solver. "

abstract = {In the present paper, a solution scheme is proposed for frictionless contact problems of linear elastic bodies, which are discretized using the finite element method with lower order elements. An approach combining the interior-point method and the semismooth Newton method is proposed. In this method, an initial active set for the semismooth Newton method is obtained from the approximate optimal solution by the interior-point method. The simplest node-to-node contact model is considered in the present paper, that is, pairs of matching nodes exist on the contact surfaces. However, the discussions can be easily extended to a node-to-segment or segment-to-segment contact model. In order to evaluate the proposed method, a number of illustrative examples of the frictionless contact problem are shown. The proposed combined method is compared with the interior-point method and the semismooth Newton method. Two numerical examples that are difficult to solve using the semismooth Newton method are solved effectively using the proposed combined method. It is shown that the proposed method converges within far fewer iterations than the semismooth Newton methods or the interior-point method. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

The method is derived from a mixed formulation which induces a contact discretization scheme in the spirit of the mortar method and naturally delivers slack variables that help constrain the solution to the feasible region. The derivation of the algorithm as well as its robustness benefits from the contact interface description that is induced by NURBS-based isogeometric volume discretizations. Various interior point algorithms are discussed, including a primal–dual approach that satisfies the unilateral contact constraints exactly, in addition to two primal approaches that retain an arbitrary barrier parameter. The developed algorithms can easily be pursued starting from an augmented Lagrangian implementation. Numerical investigations on benchmark problems demonstrate the efficiency and the robustness of the framework, but also highlight current limitations that suggest paths for future research. Overall, the results indicate that the interior point method can challenge the augmented Lagrangian method in contact mechanics, even displaying potential for higher efficiency and robustness. "

These formulations lead naturally to convex mathematical programs that can be solved using standard and readily available tools. In contrast to traditional discrete element analysis, the present granular contact dynamics formulation uses an implicit time discretization, thus allowing for large time steps. Moreover, in the limit of an infinite time step, the general dynamic formulation reduces to a static formulation that is useful in simulating common quasi-static problems such as triaxial tests and similar laboratory experiments. A significant portion of the paper is dedicated to exploring the consequences of the associated frictional sliding rule implied by the variational formulation adopted. In this connection, a new interior-point algorithm for general linear complementarity problems is developed and it is concluded that the associated sliding rule, in the context of granular contact dynamics, may be viewed as an artifact of the time discretization and that the use of an associated flow rule at the particle scale level generally is physically acceptable.

For solving monotone variational inequalities, these methods only require function evaluation, and therefore are widely applied to black-box models. In this type of methods, the distance between the iterate and a fixed solution point decreases by iterations. Furthermore, in each iteration, the negative increment of such squared distance has a differentiable concave lower bound function without requiring any solution in its formula. In this paper, we investigate some properties for the lower bound. Our study reveals that the lower bound affords a steplength domain which guarantees the convergence of the entire algorithm. Based on these results, we present two new steplengths. One involves the projection onto the tangent cone without line search, while the other can be computed via searching the positive root of a one dimension concave lower bound function. Our preliminary numerical results confirm and illustrate the attractiveness of our contributions. "

abstract="We present an algorithm which combines standard active set strategies with the gradient projection method for the solution of quadratic programming problems subject to bounds. We show, in particular, that if the quadratic is bounded below on the feasible set then termination occurs at a stationary point in a finite number of iterations. Moreover, if all stationary points are nondegenerate, termination occurs at a local minimizer. A numerical comparison of the algorithm based on the gradient projection algorithm with a standard active set strategy shows that on mildly degenerate problems the gradient projection algorithm requires considerable less iterations and time than the active set strategy. On nondegenerate problems the number of iterations typically decreases by at least a factor of 10. For strongly degenerate problems, the performance of the gradient projection algorithm deteriorates, but it still performs better than the active set method.",

Two different acceptance criteria for an approximate solution to the proximal problem are analyzed. These criteria are expressed in terms of the gradient of the proximal function, the gradient of the original function, and the iteration difference. With either acceptance criterion, the convergence results are analogous to those of the exact iterates. Preliminary numerical results are presented using some ill-conditioned CUTE test problems.",
