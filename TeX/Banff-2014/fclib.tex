  \frametitle{FCLIB : a collection of discrete 3D Frictional Contact (FC) problems}
  Our inspiration: MCPLIB or CUTEst
  \begin{block}
    {What is FCLIB ?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item A open source collection of Frictional Contact (FC) problems
      stored in a specific HDF5 format 
    \item A open source light implementation of Input/Output functions
      in C Language to read and write problems (Python and Matlab coming soon)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}


  \begin{block}
    {Goals of the project}
    Provide a standard framework for testing available and new algorithms for solving discrete frictional contact problems share common formulations of problems in order to exchange data
